# 🕹️ Minesweeper - Programming III Project

# 📌 About the Project

This project consists of the development of a graphical application of the Minesweeper game as part of the Programming III course in the Computer Engineering - Networks and Telecommunications degree. The main objective is to consolidate knowledge acquired throughout the semester by applying object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts such as inheritance, polymorphism, and event-driven programming, as well as utilizing data structures and Java Streams API.

# 🎮 Game Description

Minesweeper is a classic puzzle game where the player must uncover a grid of NxM cells, avoiding hidden mines. The game was developed using a predefined class hierarchy, including:

GameMinesweeper: Manages game logic, board state, and win/lose conditions.

MinesweeperFrame: Implements the graphical interface and user interactions.

Cell subclasses: Represent individual board cells with different properties.

The board is managed as a 2D matrix of Cell objects, where each cell can be revealed, flagged, or contain a mine. The game tracks the player’s progress and determines win/lose conditions dynamically.

# 🚀 Features

✅ Fully functional Minesweeper game with different difficulty levels✅ Graphical interface with an interactive grid✅ Timer to track the player's time✅ Win/Lose conditions with real-time updates✅ Leaderboard system that saves top scores✅ Event-driven programming using Java listeners✅ Data persistence to store player records
