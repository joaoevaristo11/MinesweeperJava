# 🕹️ Minesweeper - Programming III Project

# 📌 About the Project

This project consists of the development of a graphical application of the Minesweeper game as part of the Programming III course in the Computer Engineering - Networks and Telecommunications degree. The main objective is to consolidate knowledge acquired throughout the semester by applying object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts such as inheritance, polymorphism, and event-driven programming, as well as utilizing data structures and Java Streams API.

# 🎮 Game Description

Minesweeper is a classic puzzle game where the player must uncover a grid of NxM cells, avoiding hidden mines. The game was developed using a predefined class hierarchy, including:

GameMinesweeper: Manages game logic, board state, and win/lose conditions.

MinesweeperFrame: Implements the graphical interface and user interactions.

Cell subclasses: Represent individual board cells with different properties.

The board is managed as a 2D matrix of Cell objects, where each cell can be revealed, flagged, or contain a mine. The game tracks the player’s progress and determines win/lose conditions dynamically.

# 🚀 Features

✅ Fully functional Minesweeper game with different difficulty levels✅ Graphical interface with an interactive grid✅ Timer to track the player's time✅ Win/Lose conditions with real-time updates✅ Leaderboard system that saves top scores✅ Event-driven programming using Java listeners✅ Data persistence to store player records

# 📷 Screenshots about the project

Firstly we have 3 levels:

# Begginer

When you start the game if you click on the smile icon you will register your name:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/10c01ce5-8c75-4a90-af86-fa9418a470db)

The default name is "Player".

After this input you will start the game...

If you win this is the message that will show up on your screen:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2b561807-0523-4ab3-b018-f3890dfbd609)

On this image we can see, a message that informs you that you won, Your time, Your best Time and the top10 Players on that level.

If you loose there is a different one:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e894b5b1-a688-48d8-bf15-4fc77edf6664)

It basically says that you lost, if you have any records it will appear on the screen, but "Emanuel" doesn't have one, so it says "Emanuel has no records in Begginer level". Lastly it shows the top 10 players on that level.
